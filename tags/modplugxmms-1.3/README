Modplug Plugin for XMMS v1.1
 Based on the ModPlug sound engine by Olivier Lapicque <olivierl@jps.net>
 XMMS port by Kenton Varda <temporal@gauge3d.org>
 (C) 2000 Olivier Lapicque and Kenton Varda

Olivier Lapicque, author of Modplug, which is arguably the best quality
MOD-playing software available, has sent me the latest version (dated
2/2000) of his sound rendering code liscensed under the GPL.  This
plugin is based on that code.

Requires:
- XMMS 1.0.0 or higher
- POSIX OS (Linux or other unix*)

* This plugin is only guaranteed to work on Linux.  I have received
  conflicting reports on whether or not it will work on Solaris x86.
  One person reported that the plugin compiled fine with the
  "-fpermissive" compiler flag, which I have added.  Others had far
  more trouble.

Features:
- Plays 20 different mod formats, including:
    MOD, S3M, XM, IT, 669, AMF (both of them), AMS, DBM, DMF, DSM, FAR,
    MDL, MED, MTM, OKT, PTM, STM, ULT, and Unreal's UMX
- Plays zip, rar, and gzip compressed mods.  The following extensions are
   recognized:
    zip:  MDZ,  S3Z,  XMZ,  ITZ
    rar:  MDR,  S3R,  XMR,  ITR
    gzip: MDGZ, S3GZ, XMGZ, ITGZ
   You can also load plain old ZIP, RAR, and GZ files.  If ModPlug finds
   a mod in them, it will play it.
   Note: To play these formats, you need to have the associated
    decompression utilities (unzip, gunzip, unrar) installed.
   Note(2): The format of the mod is NOT determined from the extension on
    compressed mods.  For example, if you zipped a UMX mod and gave it the
    extension MDZ, it would work fine.
- Slightly better sound quality than Mikmod.  Vastly superior quality
   over Winamp.
- All XMMS calls are supported exept for the band gains on the
   equalizer.  The preamp is supported, but MOD music is not anywhere
   near as cheap to equalize as MP3.  Thus, equalization does is not
   supported in this version.  However, a variable bass boost option
   is available in the configuration dialog (see below).
- Tons of playback options (see below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configurable stuff and explanations:
 All of the following items are configurable from the plugin
 configuration dialog box.

Sampling rate: Higher is better but slower.

Bits per sample: 8-bit or 16-bit sound.

Channels: mono/stereo.  Four-point surround can and will be supported
 once XMMS supports it.  :)

Oversampling: This increases quality considerably by doing all
 calculations at a higher sampling rate and then mixing down to the
 desired output rate.  This should almost never be turned off.

Noise Reduction: Reduces noise. :)

Volume Ramping: Gets rid of pops and clicks.

Fast Playlist Info: When this option is on, names of songs in your
 playlist will load considerably faster, but song lengths will not be
 shown and only MOD, S3M, XM, and IT formats will have their names shown.
 Don't worry, though, because all the data which is skipped will still be
 loaded when you actually play the song.  This should probably always be
 on.

Reverb: A nice reverb effect.  The depth and delay of the reverb can be
 tuned to your liking using the sliders.

Bass boost: Variable bass boost effect.  The "range" slider controls the
 frequency range of the bass boost.  If you increase this value, higher
 frequencies will be boosted, but the overall volume increase will be
 less.  (you can compensate by using the volume slider:)

Surround: Dolby Pro-Logic surround effect.  Depth and delay can be fine
 tuned.

Fade on Stop: With this enabled, when you click stop while a mod is
 playing, it will fade out for up to two seconds (depending on where you
 set the slidebar).
 WARNING:  This is a hacked effect, and XMMS doesn't like it.  The
  following actions will result in segmentation faults when using this
  effect:
 - Skipping to an MP3 (or other non-MOD format) while Modplug is playing
 - Closing XMMS while Modplug is playing
