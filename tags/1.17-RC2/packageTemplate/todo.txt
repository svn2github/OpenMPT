This rewbs' incomplete OpenMPT TODO list.

. Misc stuff
  . Get all RC bug fixes into dev line
  . Navigation dialog (jump to row/channel)
  . Random cutoff / res variation
  . Save rows per beat/measure in song.
  . Show total channels used and total CPU Usage
  . CPU usage for each plugin
  . VU meters for each plugin
  . Clipping warning
  . Resampling mode per instrument
  . Bypass a plug from plug window
  . Move plugins in FX list
  . Clone plugins
  . Option to lock sample's frequency so its duration is X rows.
  . Optionally automatically create an instrument on adding a VSTi
  . Optionally redirect notes played on split instrument to Split MIDI Record enabled channels, if there are any.
  . Sample editor: export sample & open in external editor
  . Save plugin list in .ini as plugs are added, keep log of successfully loaded plugs on startup.
  . Optionally recurse subdirectories when adding plugs (aka scan for new plugins)
  . Prompt to load a backup on restart after a crash
  . Mark track as modified on param change


. VST compliancy
  . Support tails: stop calling process() on plugs when they aren't generating any sound. 
  . Threading cleanup
  . Add support for speaker arrangements.
  . Add support for pin properties
  . Add support for delta frames 
  . Add support for note offset
  . Add support for detune
  . Add support for VST MIDI effects.
  . Add support for fxb saving/loading

. Tuning
  . Add a choice of tuning mode per instrument.
  . Can be applied to both samples and VSTis that support detune
  . Custom tuning modes?

. Virtual instrument effect handling
  . Retrig VSTis
  . Offset VSTis (for those VSTis that support note offset)
  . Automatically map certain pattern effects to MIDI CCs (pitch bend etc..)

. Modular audio & MIDI data routing from instruments, channels and plugins, and between plugins.


. Sound driver
  . Option to leave sound driver open at all times

. Optionally show beginning sample's name instead of note in pattern editor (e.g. for multi-sample drum instruments).


. Generalise Effect parameter visualiser
  . Note visualiser
  . Volume visualiser


. Custom keys design
  . Harden subcontext/supercontext implementation, it's currently a bit approximate.
  . Make plugin windows input contexts
    . Play VSTi from plug GUI
    . Custom keys for preset manipulation

. Optional progressive buffer adjustements to achieve exact rounded BPMs.


. Fluctuators (new parameter control mechanism)
  . Linear [done]
  . Set
  . Stop
  . Oscillator
  . Random
  . Envelope bank
  . Pattern editor enhancements for fluctuators
  . Fluctuator visualiser/GUI
  . Cross-plugin parameter grouping/modulation?

. MIDI
  . Smarter MIDI-in (make use of more types of MIDI messages)
  . MIDI-out (including CCs)

. Real time paramter variation recording
  . From plugin GUI
  . From MIDI controllers

. Menu enhancements
  . Make more instrument/sample/pattern editor commands available from main menu bar
  . Make context menus customisable.
  . Improve VST preset menu to make navigating huge numbers of presets easier

. Pattern editor re-design with resizable/hideable channels, multiple effect columns etc..
