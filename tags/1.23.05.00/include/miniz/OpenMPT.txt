miniz DEFLATE implementation.
http://miniz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
v155_r4
Modifications for OpenMPT:
 * #define MINIZ_NO_STDIO has been set because OpenMPT does not need stdio functionality and miniz relies on secure-CRT file i/o functions in windows builds which are not available on all mingw64 versions.
 * GCC warning 'include/miniz/miniz.c:4099:5: warning: statement with no effect [-Wunused-value]' has been silenced.
No further changes have been made.
