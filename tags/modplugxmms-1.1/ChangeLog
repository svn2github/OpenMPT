ModPlug-XMMS v1.1, Feb. 28, 2000
+ Latest ModPlug source from Olivier Lapique.
+ You can now play compressed mods of the following formats:
  - .MDZ: Standard zipped mod.
  - .MDR: Rar compressed mod.
  - .MDGZ: Gzipped mod.  (not available on Windoze! :)
  Note: To play these formats, you need to have the associated
  decompression utilities (unzip, gunzip, unrar) installed.  To see
  if you have them installed, try typing the commands at the command
  line.

* gtk-- is no longer required.
* Fixed bug where files with capitalized extensions did not have their
  names loaded until they were played.
* GUI looks a bit nicer.
