How to compile the code:

- Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008/2010 is required. Express versions won't work as
  they don't include MFC.
- The VST 2.4 and ASIO SDKs are needed for compiling with VST and ASIO support.
  If you don't want this, uncomment #define NO_VST and #define NO_ASIO in the
  file StdAfx.h. Have a look at include/readme.txt to find out which exact files
  you need and where you can get them. If you need further help with the VST and
  ASIO SDKs, get in touch with the main developers. 
- You need the DirectX SDK to enable DirectSound output. If you don't want this,
  uncomment #define NO_DSOUND in the file StdAfx.h.
- To compile the project, open mptrack/MPTRACK.SLN (if you're using VS2003 or
  VS2005), mptrack/MPTRACK_08.SLN (VS2008) or mptrack/MPTRACK_10.SLN (VS2010)
  and hit the compile button! :)



Coding conventions (see below for an example):

* Functions / methods are "underlined" (The "//------" comment, see below for an
  example what it should look like).
* Place curly braces at the beginning of the line, not at the end
* Generally make use of the custom index types like SAMPLEINDEX or ORDERINDEX
  when referring to samples, orders, etc.
* When changing playback behaviour, make sure that you use the function
* CSoundFile::IsCompatibleMode() so that modules made with previous versions of
  MPT still sound correct (if the change is extremely small, this might be
  unnecessary)
* CamelCase function and variable names are preferred.
* When checking the module type, use something like
    if(GetType() & MOD_TYPE_XXX)
  instead of
    if(GetType() == MOD_TYPE_XXX)
  as it could be theoretically possible that two mod types are set (currently
  this doesn't happen, but in the future this might actually be used as a code
  feature :)

Code example:

void Foo::Bar(int foobar)
//-----------------------
{
    while(true)
    {
        // some code
    }
}
