This folder contains the stb_vorbis library from
https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c
(commit 4c519106a7c3862524100f907736c1c74412725d)

Modifications:
 * Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and fails
   to compile.
Modifications are always additions and have been marked with // OpenMPT.

For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
See ../build/premake/ for details.
