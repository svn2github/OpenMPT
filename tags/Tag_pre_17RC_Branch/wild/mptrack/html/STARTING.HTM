<br>
In this screen, the basic parameters of the song are set.
Most are self-explanatory. It should be noted that if you begin a tune with a 
set number of channels and decide to add more, this is the screen you want.
Simply select the [change] option, and select the number of channels desired
from the pull-down menu. This is also the place where you can convert to other 
formats. Again, select [change] and choose the file format and number of
channels desired. Don't forget to save!<br>
<br>
<b><a name="pattern">The Pattern screen</a></b><br>
<br>
<i>Getting Around in the Pattern Screen</i><br>
<br>
ModPlug is a true Windows tracker, thus navigation is done with the mouse.
Simply point and click! (Yes, you can use the cursor if you are a diehard
cursor fan!)<br>
<br>
<i>Entering information</i><br>
<br>
In the default set-up, 6 channels are displayed at a time. You can view more
channels using the scrollbar. Each channel has a set of columns within it:<br>
<br>
<b>.  .  .    .  .     .  .    .  .  .       </b> Empty columns<br>
<b>C-5     .  .     .  .    .  .  .       </b> Note column (C5 being the note C in the fifth octave)<br>
<b>.  .  .    01     .  .    .  .  .       </b> Sample/Instrument Column<br>
<b>.  .  .    .  .   v56    .  .  .       </b> Volume or Panning Column<br>
<b>.  .  .    .  .     .  .    E22       </b> Effects Column<br>
<br>
The note column is where the notes are entered. On a qwerty keyboard, the top
row (qwerty etc) would represent C4-B4, the next C5-B5, and the bottom C6-B6.
Simply press the key to enter the note.<br>
<br>
If you want to enter the same note repeatedly, highlight the note and press
the [enter] key.  Then use the spacebar to enter the notes. (This also works
with the other columns) To control how many rows are skipped between notes,
enter the number in the [spacing] box. [0] means that the note entered will
remain highlighted. [1] will automatically move the highlight to the next row,
and so on.<br>
<br>
<i>Blocks</i><br>
<br>
To highlight a block, click on the beginning of the block. Holding down the
left mouse key, drag the highlight to where you want it. Then right click to
view options, such as changing the pitch of the note, copying, cutting, etc.<br>
<br>
<i>Effects</i>
<br>
ModPlug Tracker supports effects for the IT/S3M format, and the XM/MOD format.
Which set of effects used depends on the type of module loaded or created in
the tracker. For a complete list of these effects, please check the documentation
for that particular type of tracker.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="sample">The Sample screen</a></b><br>
<br>
<i>Entering samples</i><br>
<br>
Select [new sample], the icon in the upper left-hand corner of the sample
screen. Then select the small folder icon to import the sample. To change a
sample, display the sample you want to replace and use the folder icon to get
the new sample.<br>
<br>
<i>Listen to sample</i><br>
<br>
Samples can be listened to by clicking the button with the small musical
notes on it.<br>
<br>
<i>Manipulate samples</i><br>
<br>
Samples can be amplified, normalized, reversed and resampled according to
your needs.  Loops can be created by turning the loop option on and selecting
the beginning and ending of the loop. The start point and end point will be
represented by lines through the sample.  Loops play continuously. To stop
playback at any time, select the [stop] button on the tool bar.<br>
<br>
<b><a name=instrument>The Instrument screen</a></b><br>
<br>
<i>Entering Instruments</i><br>
<br>
Instruments can be created in two ways. First, select [new instrument] in the
upper left-hand corner of the instrument screen.  Then either use the folder
icon to load a previously saved instrument, or move to the [note mapping]
section.  Change the numbers in the column to correspond to the sample you
want. If you are using one sample only, simply enter the number once, then
right click and select [map all notes to sample x].<br>
<br>
<i>Special note</i><br>
<br>
If you are making changes to an existing mod, there may be [instruments] that
are simply a line of type inserted by the previous author. In order to use
these instruments, you must first delete the instrument (use the Windows
explorer menu in the left screen, right click on the instrument name and
select [delete instrument]), then follow the steps outlined above for entering
an instrument.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Volume Envelope</i><br>
<br>
Check the [use volume envelope] box. Right click on the black box and select
[insert point]. You will need at least two points to create a volume envelope.
The top of the screen is the maximum volume, the bottom, the minimum.
Add points as necessary to make the volume fade in, fade out, or do other
tricks.<br>
<br>
<i>Panning Envelope</i><br>
<br>
Check the use [panning envelope] box. Works like the volume envelope except
the line in the center represents the center panning position.  The top
represents the right speaker, the bottom, the left.<br>
