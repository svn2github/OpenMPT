<HR><p><b><a name="baseoctave">Base Octave</a></b></p>
This number represent the base octave used for editing notes.
The dialog in the <a href="setup.htm#keyboard">View-Setup</a> menu
allows you to customize your keyboard, so that the keys are mapped
on up to 3 octaves: Base_Octave-1, Base_Octave, and Base_Octave+1.
The initial Base Octave is 5, which means that if you type the D# key
for Base_Octave+1, the note played will be a D#6.
You can set the Base Octave from 1 to 8.<BR>


<HR><p><b><a name="tempo">Tempo</a></b></p>
This number represents the current tempo (in BPMs) of the song currently
playing. You can change the tempo, but it will be overridden by any tempo
effects present in the song. The BPM displayed is accurate for a speed of 6.
<br>

<HR><p><b><a name="speed">Speed</a></b></p>
This number represents the current speed of the song, which is a tempo
divider: higher number means slower tempo. It is the number of beats (ticks)
for each row of the song. Like the tempo, you can change the speed of the
current song being played, but it will be overridden by any speed effects
present in the song.
<br>

<HR><p><b><a name="tree">Tree View</a></b></p>
The tree view on left of the screen displays the installed sound banks,
the midi library (used when importing midi files), the instrument library
(a simple instrument/sample browser), and all the songs currently opened.
<br>
You can right-click on any item, which will bring a menu with different
operation you can perform on it. The hilighted operation is the default
operation that will be performed if you double-click on the item.<br>
You can drag and drop items from and to the tree:
<ul>
<li>You can drag a file from the instrument library to an instrument in the
midi library, which will assign a specific midi instrument to this file.</li>
<li>You can drag and drop pattern numbers in the sequence list, to easily
reorder the pattern sequence</li>
<li>You can drag patterns, samples and instruments from the tree to the
pattern, sample, or instrument screen to edit them (also with double-click)</li>
<li>You can browse songs as if it was a folder with samples and instruments,
simply drag and drop a sample to the sample editor to open it</li>
</ul>
<br>
You can also use the keyboard in the tree:
<ul>
<li>Pressing Enter is equivalent to a mouse double-click</li>
<li>Pressing Space will play the selected item (samples and instruments only)</li>
<li>Pressing Delete will remove the item (Files from the instrument library will be sent to the Recycle Bin).</li>
</ul>
