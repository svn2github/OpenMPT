<HR><p><b><a name="new">New command</a></b></p>
Use this command to create a new module in ModPlug Tracker, and select
the type of song you want to create: MOD, S3M, XM or IT (Note that you can
also change the module type later). If you want to use instruments, volume
envelopes, and NNAs, you have to manually add an instrument.
It is not recommended to convert a S3M/IT/XM module to a MOD
module, since a lot of features are not supported in the MOD file format.
For more details, see also the <a href="formats.htm">Music Module File Formats</a> section.

<HR><p><b><a name="open">Open command</a></b></p>

</ul>

<HR><p><b><a name="save">Save command</a></b></p>
Saves an opened song using the same file name.
You can save the song as a MOD, S3M, XM or IT module.
See also the <a href="formats.htm">Music Module File Formats</a> section
for more details about the limitations of each file format.

<HR><p><b><a name="saveas">Save As command</a></b></p>
Saves an opened song to a specified file name.

<HR><p><b><a name="saveaswave">Save as Wave command</a></b></p>
Saves an opened song as a Wave file (Direct-to-disk recording).
The wave file will be saved with the same attributes than the ones
defined in the Player/Soundcard Setup dialog. (Using the same mixing
rate, and player options). The "Advanced Soundcard Setup" options
have no effect on the wave file quality. Note that the wave writer
has a slightly better quality resampler, and if you select the
'Normalize' option, the saved wave file will probably have a better
Signal/Noise ratio (SNR).<br>
If you want to put your song on a CD, make sure you select 44100Hz,
stereo, 16-bit in the soundcard setup.

<HR><p><b><a name="saveasmp3">Save as MP3 command</a></b></p>
Saves the current song as a MPEG Layer3 file (MP3 or WAV Layer3).<br>
Note that this option will be available only if you have a MPEG Layer3
encoder installed. This function will NOT normalize the output of the file,
and the AGC may be active, so make sure you select an appropriate volume
level, or use the Save As Wave function to save the song as a normalized
WAV file, and then use an external MPEG Layer3 encoder to convert the file.

<HR><p><b><a name="saveasmid">Export as Midi command</a></b></p>
Saves the current song as a MID or RMI file.<br>
You will need to manually assign each instrument to a midi program or percussion 
number. Only the basic notation will be saved, since most tracker effects do not
have midi equivalents.

<HR><p><b><a name="close">Close command</a></b></p>
This will close the current opened window.

<HR><p><b><a name="importlib">Import Midi Library</a></b></p>
This command will import the instrument definition file used when importing
midi files (saved in mptrack.ini). This allows you to keep different midi
configurations. If the file you choose is a DLS or SF2 sound bank, all midi
instruments will be mapped to this bank.<br>
When you import the midi from a sound bank, you will be asked if you want
to replace only the missing instruments. Choosing YES will replace only
the midi instruments that are not yet mapped to a sound bank. Choosing NO
will map all midi instruments to the selected sound bank (if they are present).
The midi libary's instruments are used when importing midi files.
<br>

<HR><p><b><a name="importdls">Add Sound Bank</a></b></p>
This command allows you to add a new sound bank (displayed in the tree view
after the midi library) to import instruments from. If you have DirectX 6.1,
you should also have a file called GM.DLS in your windows\system folder
(Windows95), or in windows\system32\drivers (Windows98).
DLS stands for DownLoadable Sounds.
Each sound bank contains a large set of melodic instruments and drum kits.
Note that you can't install more than 10 different DLS/SF2 sound banks.
You can double-click on an instrument in the sound bank to hear it. If you want to
use the instrument in your song, just drag it and drop it into the instrument
editor window (or sample editor if you only want to load the raw sample data).

<HR><p><b><a name="exit">Exit command</a></b></p>
Exits ModPlug Tracker.
