ModPlug Tracker is freeware and may be freely distributed.
As it is a freeware, I am not responsible for any
problems that could be caused by the usage of this program.<br>
THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY INTENDED FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE.<BR>
(FAQ: Yes, you can release your songs created with MPT commercially
without paying anything to anybody)
<br>
My only goal for writing ModPlug Tracker is to try to spread out tracked
music, taking it out of DOS-World, and try to keep it free.<BR>

<hr><p><b><a name="contact">Contact / Technical Support</a></b></p>
For any technical questions, or bug report, you can contact me at
"olivier@modplug.com". Also check often the ModPlug Central web site
for the latest releases: "http://www.modplug.com".
(I usually also have beta versions on my home page at
"http://pweb.jps.net/~olivierl", but it might be buggy, and the
site is not as fast).
Do not hesitate to post your questions on internet, there is a quick link
in the help menu to go to the Modplug Central bulletin boards, where other
users may be able to answer your questions<br>
<BR>

Please try to be precise when sending bug reports (I don't really have
the time for 'This song doesn't play right.'. If possible, try to localise
the problem by creating a short song with a couple of patterns reproducing
the bug. Try including a quick description of your system (processor, operating
system, sound card, and amount of memory)<BR>

ModPlug Tracker is a 32-bit Win32 application, featuring a lot of
options to create the best possible output (Up to 48KHz, 16-bit, stereo):<br>
- 32-bit internal precision for mixing, dithered to 16-bit.<br>
- Very high quality resampling filter.<br>
- Support for MMX/3DNow!/SSE instructions<br>
- Automatic click removal<br>
- Digital Bass Expansion filter (filter range and depth customizable in Advanced Player Options)<br>
- Dolby Pro-Logic Surround support with custom delay.<br>
- Reverberator engine, with environment presets.
- HF Noise Reduction: attenuation of the background noise by filtering very high
  frequencies in the sound.<br>
- Stereo Separation option (25%-400%), useful for headphones.<br>
- 6-bands Graphic Equalizer (requires fast floating point support).<br>
- DirectSound support for low-latency mixing on hardware-accelerated soundcards<br>
<BR>

<hr><p><b><a name="mptintl">International Versions</a></b></p>
Modplug Tracker is written with a default page code of 0409 (English - US)<br>
You can freely edit the resources to make a localized version of Modplug Tracker,
although some strings are hardcoded in the code (not as resources).<br>
I am trying to improve the support for easier localization, but it is a lot of work.<br>
However, starting from v1.15.0154, MPT supports localized strings in the file MPT_INTL.INI<br>
This file contains string sections for a specific language id. For example, in Australia, MPT will
look for strings in the [Strings.0C09] (0C09=Australian English language id). If it isn't found, then it
will look in the [Strings.0009] section (generic english), if not found, it will look in the
[Strings] section (no language id), and if still not found, it will use the default value for the string.<br>
For example, to set the option names in the setup general tab, the strings would be<br>
<i>Setup.Gen.Opt1.Name=Play new notes while recording</i><br>
<i>Setup.Gen.Opt1.Desc=When this option is enabled, notes entered in the pattern editor will always be played (If not checked, notes won't be played in record mode).</i><br>
Feel free to email me if you have specific questions about this.<br>

<br><li><b>1.00b - beta</b></li><br>
This is the first public release of ModPlug Tracker Beta (June 18, 1998).
The help file is still quite small, but the interface has been completely
redesigned, so it's MUCH easier to use. Drawing in the pattern editor needs
to be optimized. This release also include basic Midi support (no sync on
midi clock yet) and low-latency DirectSound buffers.<br>

<br><li><b>1.00a - alpha</b></li><br>
This is the first alpha release of ModPlug Tracker (October 15, 1997).
A lot of features are still missing, but the copy/cut/paste, and support
for XI instruments makes ModPlug Tracker good enough for an alpha version.
I have to work on the help too.<br>

<br><li><b>0.0xa - pre-alpha:</b></li><br>
This is the first public release of ModPlug Tracker (09/19/97).<br>
