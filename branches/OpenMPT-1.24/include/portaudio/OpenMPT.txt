 - Portaudio SVN revision 1948
 - A small modification to portaudio code has been made in src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c
   to facilitate linking against strmiids.lib . Look for "OpenMPT" there.
 - For building, premake4 is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
   See ../premake4.lua for details.
 - A couple of unnecessary folders have been omitted in SVN:
   bindings, build, cmake_support, doc, examples, pablio, test, testcvs

   NOTE: Various versions of the Windows SDK (such as the one provided with the VS2008 x64 compiler) 
   do not provide ksguid.lib. To simplify the build configuration, PA_WDMKS_NO_KSGUID_LIB
   is defined in the premake projects to always use PortAudio's workaround, regardless of
   the compiler version used.
