Note: The SoundTouch package has pretty much been left untouched (pardon the pun),
except for a small change in SoundTouchDLL.h:

The "samples" parameter type of soundtouch_putSamples (line 116) has been changed
from float to short.  

For building, premake4 is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
See ../premake4.lua for details.
