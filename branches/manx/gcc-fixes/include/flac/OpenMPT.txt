The FLAC package has been left pretty much untouched, except for a few changes:
- Obviously, unnecessary folders and files (documentation, makefiles, etc.) have
  been removed.
- The existing libFLAC_static project files have been upgraded to VS2008 and
  VS2010. The following changes have been made:
  - Output directory for the library has been changed to ..\..\lib\
  - Output filename has been changed to ..\..\lib\libFLAC_staticd.lib (debug)
    and ..\..\lib\libFLAC_static.lib (release). 
  - ASM files and nasm.h have been excluded from the project to be able to
    compile without NASM.
  - *ogg*.c/h files have been excluded from the project to be able to compile
    without libvorbis.
  - The following preprocessor directives have been removed from both debug
    and release configurations: FLAC__HAS_OGG;FLAC__CPU_IA32;FLAC__HAS_NASM
  - Debug configurations have been changed to use a multi-threaded debug DLL
    runtime library (/MDd)
