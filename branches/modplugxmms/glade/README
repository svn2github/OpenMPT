Glade project files for Modplug-XMMS

Since this is my first attempt at useful GUI programming
(I usually use only text and OpenGL), I decided to use
Glade and Glademm.  However, after building these sources,
I made several changes to them, making these project files
slightly outdated.  You have been warned. :)
