v2004.02.16   Author: Rewbs  Contact: f99.doc.ic.ac.uk
-------------------------------------------------------
Experimental features in this version:

1. A Dry/wet slider for each plugin - values should save and load in this version, and be cleanly ignored by older versions.
   Should also work properly now. :)

2. Tick resolution midi macro slide. Use \xx command instead of Zxx if you want your plugin param to slide to xx over the course of that row rather than brutally jumping there. Should also work on built-in cutoff+resonance. For an example of what this effect does, download: http://www.soal.org/expMPT/paramSlideDemo.zip .

3. Effect param graphical editor prototype. Left click modifies a single node, right click & drag to "draw".
   Warning, things get quite sluggish if you're visualizing many rows and make the window quite large.
   Known bugs:
    . Occasional visual glitches: nodes sometimes don't get erased with large window size; resize the window to clear it up.
    . you have to move the focus back to the pattern to undo

4. Mixpaste, just like in IT2

5. Option to have "follow song" disabled by default under general settings.

6. SDx works on VSTis.
