<h2>3. About implementation &amp; Usage tips</h2>
<h3>3.3. About algorithms</h3>
<p><em>Time-stretching </em>means changing
the audio stream duration without affecting it's pitch. SoundTouch
uses WSOLA-like time-stretching routines that operate in the time
domain. Compared to sample rate transposing, time-stretching is a
much heavier operation and also requires a longer processing
"window" of sound samples used by the
processing algorithm, thus increasing the algorithm input/output
latency. Typical i/o latency for the SoundTouch
time-stretch algorithm is around 100 ms.</p>
<h3>3.4 Tuning the algorithm parameters</h3>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm has few
parameters that can be tuned to optimize sound quality for
certain application. The current default parameters have been
chosen by iterative if-then analysis (read: "trial and error")
to obtain best subjective sound quality in pop/rock music
processing, but in applications processing different kind of
sound the default parameter set may result into a sub-optimal
result.</p>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm default
parameter values are set by these #defines in file "TDStretch.h":</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#define DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS     82
#define DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS   28
#define DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS      12</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These parameters affect to the time-stretch
algorithm as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS</strong>: This is
the default length of a single processing sequence in milliseconds
which determines the how the original sound is chopped in
the time-stretch algorithm. Larger values mean fewer sequences
are used in processing. In principle a larger value sounds better when
slowing down the tempo, but worse when increasing the tempo and vice
versa.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS</strong>: The seeking window
default length in milliseconds is for the algorithm that seeks the best
possible overlapping location. This determines from how
wide a sample "window" the algorithm can use to find an optimal mixing
location when the sound sequences are to be linked back together.<br>
    <br>
The bigger this window setting is, the higher the possibility to find a
better mixing position becomes, but at the same time large values may
cause a "drifting" sound artifact because neighboring sequences can be
chosen at more uneven intervals. If there's a disturbing artifact that
sounds as if a constant frequency was drifting around, try reducing
this setting.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS</strong>: Overlap
length in milliseconds. When the sound sequences are mixed back
together to form again a continuous sound stream, this parameter
defines how much the ends of the consecutive sequences will overlap with each other.<br>
    <br>
    This shouldn't be that critical parameter. If you reduce the
DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS setting by a large amount, you might wish to try a
smaller value on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that these parameters can also be
set during execution time with functions "<strong>TDStretch::setParameters()</strong>"
and "<strong>SoundTouch::setSetting()</strong>".</p>
<p>The table below summarizes how the
parameters can be adjusted for different applications:</p>
