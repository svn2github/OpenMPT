How to compile the code:

- Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008/2010 is required. Express versions won't work as
  they don't include MFC.
- The VST 2.4 and ASIO SDKs are needed for compiling with VST and ASIO support.
  If you don't want this, uncomment #define NO_VST and #define NO_ASIO in the
  file StdAfx.h. If you need further help with the VST and ASIO SDKs, get in
  touch with the main developers.
- You need the DirectX SDK to enable DirectSound output. If you don't want this,
  uncomment #define NO_DSOUND in the file StdAfx.h.



Coding conventions (see below for an example):

* Functions / methods are "underlined" (The "//------" comment, see below for an
  example what it should look like).
* Place curly braces at the beginning of the line, not at the end
* Generally make use of the custom index types like SAMPLEINDEX or ORDERINDEX
  when referring to samples, orders, etc.
* When changing playback behaviour, make sure that you use the function
* CSoundFile::IsCompatibleMode() so that modules made with previous versions of
  MPT still sound correct (if the change is extremely small, this might be
  unnecessary)
* CamelCase function and variable names are preferred.
* When checking the module type, use something like
    if(GetType() & MOD_TYPE_XXX)
  instead of
    if(GetType() == MOD_TYPE_XXX)
  as it could be theoretically possible that two mod types are set (currently
  this doesn't happen, but in the future this might actually be used as a code
  feature :)

Code example:

void Foo::Bar(int foobar)
//-----------------------
{
    while(true)
    {
        // some code
    }
}
