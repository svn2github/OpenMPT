; This file is provided for creating an install package without the proprietary unmo3.dll (for example for the SourceForge package).
; Instead of including the file in the setup package, the user instead has the possibility to automatically download unmo3.dll from
; our servers.
; The download code requires the ISTool IDE with its downloader extension.
; You can download ISTool from http://www.istool.org/
; This installer is deprecated. Use install-unmo3-free-itd.iss instead.
