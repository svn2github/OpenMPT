Migrating from OpenMPT 1.17
---------------------------

Unless you install OpenMPT in portable mode, all settings are now stored in
%appdata%\OpenMPT. The installer will automatically try to move all settings
to the new folder - Migration is done automatically.


Uninstallation
--------------

An uninstaller is provided. Don't worry, it will ask you if you want to keep
your personal settings, none of these will be deleted automatically.
