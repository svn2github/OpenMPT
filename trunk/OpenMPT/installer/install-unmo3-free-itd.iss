; OpenMPT Install script for InnoSetup

; This file is provided for creating an install package without the proprietary unmo3.dll (for example for the SourceForge package).
; Instead of including the file in the setup package, the user instead has the possibility to automatically download unmo3.dll from
; our servers.
; The download code requires the InnoIDE with its downloader extension which currently only works in ANSI version!
; To download and install InnoIDE, get the Inno Setup QuickStart Pack from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php#qsp (don't use the unicode pack!)
; it_download.iss and it_download.dll have to be placed in same directory as the file you are currently viewing.
