 - Portaudio version svn-r1910 as of 2013-09-07.
 - A small modification to portaudio code has been made in src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c
   to facilitate linking against strmiids.lib . Look for "OpenMPT" there.
 - The VS2008 x64 SDK does not provide ksguid.lib. src/os/win/pa_win_wdmks_utils.c
   has a work-around for this problem. Code has been added to automatically activate the work-
   around in this case. Look for "OpenMPT".
 - Portaudio can freeze on Windows XP when intializing Kernel Streaming and the sound setup
   topology doesn't meet some assumptions Portaudio seems to make. There is no official fix
   for this yet, but a fix has been posted on the Audacity mailing list
   (http://sourceforge.net/p/audacity/mailman/message/31421748/). Modifications
   have been applied to src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c to fix this problem,
   look for the LASSESB_GCP_LOOP_DETECTION.
 - For building, premake4 is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
   See ../premake4.lua for details.
