 - Portaudio SVN revision r1963, 2015-10-21
 - A small modification to portaudio code has been made in src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c
   to facilitate linking against strmiids.lib . Look for "OpenMPT" there.
 - src/common/pa_front.c has been fixed to compile with a C89 compiler.
   Modifications have been marked with // OpenMPT.
 - src/hostapi/dsound/pa_win_ds.c unconditionally defined _WIN32_WINNT.
   Only define it if it has not been defined already.
   Modifications have been marked with // OpenMPT.
 - src/os/win/pa_x86_plain_converters.c has been modified to exclude inline asm for Clang/C2.
   Modifications have been marked with // OpenMPT.
 - build/msvc/portaudio.def has been modified. Modifications are marked with
   ";OpenMPT".
 - For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
   See ../build/premake/ for details.
 - A couple of unnecessary folders have been omitted in SVN:
   bindings, cmake_support, doc, examples, pablio, test, testcvs

   NOTE: Various versions of the Windows SDK (such as the one provided with the VS2008 x64 compiler) 
   do not provide ksguid.lib. To simplify the build configuration, PA_WDMKS_NO_KSGUID_LIB
   is defined in the premake projects to always use PortAudio's workaround, regardless of
   the compiler version used.
