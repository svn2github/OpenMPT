All modifications to existing files have been done in a manner so that no
existing lines were edited; only new lines were added.
Added lines can be found by looking for "// OPENMPT ADDITION" comments.

The most important modifications have been done in file.cpp / file.hpp to allow
memory-based files (using OpenMPT's own FileReader class).
In other files, optimizations have been done to elimiate dead code that would
never be used in OpenMPT's context.

The following files have been modified:
arcread.cpp, extract.cpp, filcreat.cpp, file.hpp, file.cpp, filefn.cpp,
find.cpp, match.cpp, os.hpp, pathfn.cpp, rar.hpp, rdwrfn.cpp, secpassword.cpp,
system.cpp, timefn.cpp, volume.cpp, win32acl.cpp, win32lnk.cpp

The following new files have been added:
openmpt.hpp, openmpt-callback.hpp

For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
See ../build/premake/ for details.
