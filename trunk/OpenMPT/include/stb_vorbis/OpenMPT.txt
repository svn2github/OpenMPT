This folder contains the stb_vorbis library from
https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c
(commit 9d9f75eb682dd98b34de08bb5c489c6c561c9fa6)

Modifications:
 *  Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and
    fails to compile.
 *  Macro redefinition of alloca with mingw-w64 has been fixed.
 *  Macro redefinition of STB_VORBIS_NO_STDIO has been fixed.
Modifications are always additions and have been marked with // OpenMPT.
