miniz DEFLATE implementation.
https://github.com/richgel999/miniz
2.0.6 beta
Modifications for OpenMPT:
 *  #define MINIZ_NO_STDIO has been set because OpenMPT does not need stdio
    functionality and miniz relies on secure-CRT file i/o functions in windows
    builds which are not available on all mingw64 versions.
 *  #define MINIZ_USE_UNALIGNED_LOADS_AND_STORES 0 is used unconditionally,
    because unaligned access is undefined behaviour.
 *  Various warnings in platform detection logic using undefined macros have
    been fixed.
No further changes have been made.
